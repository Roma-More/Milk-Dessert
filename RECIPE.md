Step 1 
Take 1 cup water in a cooking pot and add 1/2 cup sugar to it with some saaffron threads. Bring if to a soft boil. You have to continuously stir it. Do not thicken the sugar syrup. After it starts boiling, heat it for 1 minute and set aside.

Step 2
In a bowl take 2 cups of milk (approx.1/2 litre) and add 1/4 cup of Maida and 2 tbsp of cornflour. Wisk it until the mixture is lump free. There should be no lumps in your mixture.

Step 3 
Take this milk mixture in a pan and heat it on medium flame. You have to continuously stir it. After it thickens a little, add 1/4 cup of milkpowder and 1/2 tsp vanilla essence and 2 tsp sugar. Continuously stir the mixture until lump free. After this mixture thickens, turn off the heat.

Step 4
Take a medium sized tray for setting. First place 6-8 marie biscuits at the bottom os the tray. Then add half of the sugar syrup that we prepared in Step 1.On top of that add half of the milk mixture. Now again add 6-8 marie biscuits and then add rest of the sugar syrup. Add the remaining milk mixture on it. Garnish it with chopped almonds or you can chose your toppings.
